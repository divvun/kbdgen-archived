        <h1>Keyboards for Northern Sami</h1>
        <p>This installer contains Northern Sami keyboards from the
        <a href="http://divvun.no">Divvun group</a> at the
        UiT Arctic university of Norway. Further information can be found on the
        <a href="https://giellalt.uit.no/keyboards/kbdlangdocs/sme/doc/index.html"
        >home page of the Northern Sami keyboad</a>, including a
        picture of the keyboard layout.</p>

        <h2>Included keyboards</h2>
        <p>The installer contains X keyboard layouts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>for Y, based on the standard Y keyboard</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means that everything that is <em>not</em> specific to
        Northern Sami
        is exactly where it is on the standard keyboard.</p>

        <h2>Activation instructions</h2>
        <p>After installation, you active the keyboard by opening <strong>System
        Preferences… &gt; Keyboard &gt; Input Methods</strong>, and adding the
        newly installed keyboard by clicking the plus sign in the lower left
        corner. Detailed instructions can be found on the <a
        href="http://divvun.no/keyboards/userdocs/mac/enable-keyboard-osx10.12.html"
