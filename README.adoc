# kbdgen

## User documentation

See the link:docs/index.adoc[kbdgen User Manual]!

## Developer documentation

As of version 2.0,
kbdgen is written in a combination of Rust and Python.
https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer[PyOxidizer] is used
to bundle a Python interpreter in the Rust binary
so end users don't have to concern themselves with installing additional dependencies.

### Start hacking on kbdgen

. Install the latest stable Rust version using https://rustup.rs[Rustup]

. Install pyoxidizer:

.. Make sure you have a C compiler, usual build tools like Make, and probably also openssl headers installed,
so you can compile the Python interpreter and its standard library.

.. Install the pyoxidizer version.
The quickest way is using `cargo install pyoxidizer --vers 0.6.0`.

. Build the project using `cargo build`.

### Rendering the documentation

The kbdgen User Manual can be found in `docs/`
and is written in AsciiDoc.

To render it,
install https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor],
go into the `docs/` directory,
and run `asciidoctor --verbose index.adoc` .

NOTE: Some parts of the documentation are actually automatically generated
by using a special derive macro on some structs.
See `./derive-collect-docs` for more information.
